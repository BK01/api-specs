For example, given the address 1640 East Kent Ave S, Vancouver, BC, is East part of the street name or a streetDirection? Given there is already a street Direction of "S" after the street type, East is likely part of the street name. A trickier example is North Park St. Is the word "North" a street direction or a part of the street name. Because it is not abbreviated, "North" is probably part of the street name. The street name in N Park St could be either Park or North Park.</td>
