This document defines aspects of the REST API that are not covered in the Swagger definition of the \nanonymous geocoder\n or the \ngated geocoder\n. You can explore the API in the API console for the \nanonymous geocoder\n or the \ngated geocoder\n. To simplify integration of the online geocoder into your client web application, you can use the \nJavascript API\n \n\n\n\nAPI Changes in v2.0.1\n\n\nThere are no API changes in v2.0.1\n\n\nResource Overview\n\n\nThe Online Geocoder offers resources for validating and geocoding an address (including public and related business occupants); finding a given site, intersection, and occupant; and finding sites, intersections, and occupants near a point or within an area. \nThe current baseUrl for the online geocoder is:\n\nhttp://apps.gov.bc.ca/pub/geocoder\n\nThe baseUrl for the online geocoder under the HTTP Secure protocol is:\n \nhttps://apps.gov.bc.ca/pub/geocoder\n\n\nAddresses Resource\n\n\nThe addresses resource represents all addresses in the geocoder. A request on this resource to find a query address will return one or more matching addresses that are standardized and geocoded (i.e., given a point location on the earth). \n\n\nA query address can be specified in two different ways:\n\n\n\n\nA single address string containing all elements of an address as in:\n\nhttp://apps.gov.bc.ca/pub/geocoder/addresses.geojson?addressString=525%20superior%20st,%20victoria,%20bc\n \n\n\nIndividual address elements as in:\n\nhttp://apps.gov.bc.ca/pub/geocoder/addresses.geojson?civicNumber=525&streetName=superior&streetType=st&localityName=victoria&provinceCode=BC\n\n\n\n\nHere are some more example geocoder requests:\n\n\n\n\nGeocode 456 Gorge Rd E, Victoria, BC\n \nhttp://apps.gov.bc.ca/pub/geocoder/addresses.xhtml?addressString=456%20Gorge%20Rd%20e%20victoria%20bc\n\n\nGeocode 7-955 13th Ave, Valemount, BC\n\nhttp://apps.gov.bc.ca/pub/geocoder/addresses.xhtml?addressString=7-955%2013th%20ave,%20Valemount,bc\n \n\n\nGeocode the intersection at Johnson and Government\n\nhttp://apps.gov.bc.ca/pub/geocoder/addresses.xhtml?addressString=johnson%20and%20government\n \n\n\nGeocode 5671 Malibu Terrace, Nanaimo, BC and return results in GEOJSON and BC Albers projection\n\nhttp://apps.gov.bc.ca/pub/geocoder/addresses.geojson?outputSRS=3005&addressString=5671%20malibu%20terrace%20nanaimo%20bc\n\n\nGeocode 5670 Malibu Terrace, Nanaimo and return the location along the road centreline for using in routing\n\nhttp://apps.gov.bc.ca/pub/geocoder/addresses.kml?locationDescriptor=routingPoint&addressString=5670%20malibu%20terrace%20nanaimo%20bc\n\n\nGeocode 5670 Malibu Terrace, Nanaimo and return accessPoint set back four metres from the curb towards the inside of the property.

If a site has no driveway or access lane, the accessPoint will be located in the middle of the entrance walkway.    accessPointRetireDate  The date the access point was retired.    accessPointStatus  The status of the access point (active, or retired). A civic access point is usually only Retired if the associated site is renumbered, destroyed, or combined with another site. A non-civic access point is usually retired when its associated site is assigned a civic number or the site becomes unoccupied.    Adaptive Address Interpolation  The process of inferring the location of a site with a given  civic number  using a road centreline, an address range, and other known site locations for a given block face. Adaptive interpolation uses the ratio (civicNumber - precedingKnownCivicNumber) / (followingKnownCivicNumber - precedingKnownCivicNumber) and the locations of the preceding, known civic number and the following, known civic number.    addressString  Civic address  or  intersection address  as a single string in  Single-line Address Format .

Each fault contains the nature of the fault, the address element affected, and the fault penalty. Here is the  complete list of faults   .    frontDoorPoint  A point representing the position of the front door or main entrance to a house or building.    fullAddress  The cleaned, standardized, and validated address of a site or intersection as a single string in  Single-line Address Format .    fullSiteDescriptor  That portion of  fullAddress  that precedes the  civic number  (in the case of a civic address) or the  localityName  (in the case of a non-civic address). Here is an example: RM 104, Student Union Building -- University of Victoria    geomark  A point, line, or polygon of interest that can be shared in a variety of formats and map projections. Geomarks are created by the  Geomark Service .    geomarkURL  The URL of a polygon geomark that should be used by the geocoder as a bounding box in the /bgeo/sites/within query. Point and line geomarks will not work. When specifying this URL programmatically, it should be url-encoded without format and projection parameters.    imageUrl  URL of an occupant's photo or picture    Interpolated Site  A  site  whose  civic number  is assumed to be valid because it lies within a known address range and whose location was interpolated using the address range (e.g.,  linear address interpolation ) or the address range plus the locations of known sites (e.g.,  adaptive address interpolation ).    interpolation  In the case of a block level match, the method of interpolation to determine how far down the block the  accessPoint  should be. The geocoder supports  linear  and  adaptive  interpolation.    Intersection  A dead-end or the intersection of two or more roads.    intersectionID  A unique and immutable identifier assigned to a given intersection in the Integrated Transportation Network.    Intersection Address  The intersection of two or more named streets as a single string.

It may also be an official name of a natural feature from the  BC Geographical Names Information System (BCGNIS) . A locality name that starts with a directional is not abbreviated (e.g., North Vancouver, not N Vancouver). Spelling of localities that are place names or natural feature names MUST match that published by BCGNIS.    localityType  The type of address authority that assigned the  localityName  to the address.    location  The coordinate pair of the matched location in the requested  projection .    locationPositionalAccuracy  The positional accuracy of the location of a site as follows: high \u2013 observed or measured using GPS or survey instruments, or digitized off imagery with a resolution of 1m or better medium \u2013 derived from parcel boundaries or from a point known to be inside a parcel that contains the site low \u2013 interpolated along a block face address range Coarse \u2013 position represents an entire street, locality, or province    locationDescriptor  Describes the nature of the address location. Values include  accessPoint ,  frontDoorPoint ,  parcelPoint ,  rooftopPoint , and  routingPoint . As an input parameter, a value of any is allowed. When any is specified, a point type other than accessPoint will be returned if one is defined; otherwise, an accessPoint will be returned.    Main Location  A geometric point representing the rooftop, front door, or centre of the property.    matchFaultPenalty  Defines the penalty value of each possible fault. Penalties are subtracted from the appropriate precision level points to arrive at a match score.    matchPrecision  The level of precision of an address match.
